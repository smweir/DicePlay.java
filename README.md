//Die Class Created by Professor
The ArrayPlay program performs several operations using arrays, including initializing, modifying, and copying elements. It also simulates rolling a die and counts the occurrences of each face.

Key Parts of the Code:
Array Initialization:
The program initializes an integer array array of size 6 to count occurrences of die rolls, and a double array array1 with predefined values.

Setting Initial Values:
It first sets all values of array to -1, then prints them.
Subsequently, it sets all values to 0 and prints them again.

Simulating Die Rolls:
The program simulates 100 rolls of a die using the dice.roll() method and increments the corresponding index in the array based on the result of each roll.

Copying Arrays:
The program displays the contents of array1 and array2 before copying.
It copies values from array1 to array2 and prints both arrays again.
After the copy, it modifies specific elements in both arrays and prints the final states of both arrays.

Expected Output:
The program produces the following types of output:
The initial state of array (after setting values to -1 and then 0).
The results of rolling the die, indicating how many times each face was rolled.
The contents of array1 and array2 before and after copying, as well as after modifying some values.
